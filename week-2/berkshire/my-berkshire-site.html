<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Seeing someone else in action that knew HTML better than me was pretty neat. Using my limited knowledge of syntax basically meant that I used code I knew, like <p> and <h1>, etc.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was kind of tough depending on what you were looking for. For example, finding the horizontal line <hr> took a while on Google. Also, I realized after ending the call with my pair that part that the Geico image was actually a link. My pair was very good at HTML so she may have known the answer, but I found it was better researching it on my own and figuring it out. Generally, you can find things pretty quickly, and online resources are abundant.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I wanted to, but controlled myself. I believe we nailed it.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The nice part is you can tell when sections end by the / tag, and reading it is relatively straight forward. For example, I was able to quickly understand my pair's code and we were able to switch fluidly. I also like that you can very quickly and easily check your code on Chrome or any browser. A quick command+s, command+tab, and command+r will show your progress with resolving an issue or how added content looks.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I wish I had some! I got stuck on some slightly off HTML grammar when making the Geico image a link that kept making the text after it a link. I had to very carefully look at the exact grammar, so I guess that would be my advice if someone has an issue with their code.
