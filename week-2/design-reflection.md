#Design Reflection#
##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?##
Information Gathering - Purpose, goals, target audience, and content.
Planning - Develop a site map, which is the list of all main topic areas of the site. Decide what technologies are required for each part (eg. WordPress, or CMS)
Design - In my opinion, this is the most important part of the site and brings all of the other elements together. It is both the aesthetic feel and the functionality of the site.
Development - This is where code meets Sublime, and JPEGs meet host servers.
Testing and Delivery - Pretty self explanatory. Make sure it works properly.
Maintenance - This is probably the longest phase since it really never ends. Iterate, iterate, iterate.
##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?##
My primary goal will be to get people interested programming or finance to come back to the site in the future... then offer me high paying jobs.
##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?##
My target audience loves stocks, and they hate slow code and shodding programming. I will address them by having clean HTML and some nuggets of stock market gold.
##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.##
I want them to see my portfolio and read my blog. Hopefully they want to bookmark the site for later, and then come back and hire me.
##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?##
Design and user experience are different, although similar. Design is how everything looks, and there are many design elements inside of the user experience. User experience is both the look and feel of the site, but also how it all fits together and how the user navigates and interacts with the site.
##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?##
User experience design is designing the website around how your users want to use it instead of what you want to show them. Users should enjoy the site, it should be simple and easy to figure out. For example, you may want a user to answer some questions and perhaps give you their e-mail address, but if you throw too many questions at a new user they may abandon the site. This is valuable because the ultimate goal of business is to reduce friction to the consumer and provide things they want. The difficulty, however, is not in knowing what users know they want. It's knowing what users don't know they know they want.
##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?##
All of the article reading was very tedious. A lot of information thrown at you at once.
