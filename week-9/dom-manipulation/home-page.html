<!--
What did you learn about the DOM?

In terms of what I didn't aready know, I learned how to link a JS file to an HTML file and how to
have multiple functions activate on a website without a button. Before, I was writing all JS inside
of the HTML file and using buttons to activate them. The other important thing I learned is knowing
when to iterate (eg. when you have multiple classes.)

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

The document... method is good to change elements inside of HTML tags. Using .style, .innerHTML,
.className are all useful as well. -->
