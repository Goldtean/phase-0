# 1.1 Think About Time
I am a huge believer in "fake it till you make it" because I faked it until I made it, and once I was it in a Disney like moment realized that I had been it all the time. I just read about the opposite approach, which is to do small things to build your confidence. That seemed to be the over-arching theme, which I semi discovered already. For example, I bought a $40 chin up bar at Wal-Mart and started doing as many chin-ups as I possibly could twice a day. At first it was 1, now I can do 8.

Time Boxing is starting a task and stopping at a pre-determined time period rather than when the task is complete. It is similar to the pomodoro technique. Currently, I use my Outlook calendar at work for time management and I use the calendar in my head the rest of the time. It works, but since I've lived with access to the internet for the last decade and a half and am not a billionaire or even a millionaire I think I could improve.

I did not have an overall plan for Phase 0 other than to try to start everything as early as possible. My new strategy is to incorporate the time box by starting a timer when I start something and reviewing the work I've done by the end. I may start an excel spreadsheet to track my progress. I also plan on starting some new habits, and am thinking of some existing habits to use as anchors.

# 1.2 The Command Line
Bash is the Terminal, which is a more direct way to interact with your computer. The most challenging part for me was watching the video and wondering how I can turn my background black and my text green so it looks like in The Matrix! Actually, the video was a bit tough at first without reading through The Command Line Crash Course.

I was able to use all the commands, and I would say that the one that strikes me as the most useful was "cat", which lets you write into files from the terminal. But overall they're all useful - moving, copying, doing a "less" to see what's inside, or a "cat" to stream what's inside.

This list looked really scary, but I think I know them all.

path to current directory -pwd

list of files and directories in current directory -ls

move a file or directory -mv

move into a directory -cd

cd .. moves you into the directory your directory is in -../

create empty files -touch

make an empty directory -mkdir

see what's in a file. Loads file faster because it doesn't load the entire file. Can skip pages, etc. -less

remove directory. Only works when it's empty -rmdir

remove file -rm

gives help, but "man" is better -help
